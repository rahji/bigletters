# Big Letters

This is a fork of [large-type.com](http://large-type.com), which allows you to display and share text in a large font, directly from your browser.

I tweaked the [original author](https://twitter.com/dbader_org)'s [elegantly written code](https://github.com/dbader/large-type.com) to accommodate the needs of my 3-year-old. This version does without UI elements beyond the text field (including the ability to share the URL and the numbers that appear at the bottom of the big letters). Also, the Enter key clears the text.

You should probably go to [large-type.com](http://large-type.com) instead, but if you want to use this simplified version, you can go to [rahji.github.io/bigletters](https://rahji.github.io/bigletters).
